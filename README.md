# Pokemon Analysis with Pandas
In this analysis, I'm using Kaggle Notebook (dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/onurgitmez/pokemon-stats-gen-1-9) to answer 3 questions:
1. Type distribution for each generation
2. Most popular dual type combination
3. Single type v dual type - which stats is better?

### Packages used
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Process
Examining the data, Data cleanup (check for null values, replace values), Adding generation & legendary columns to the dataframe

# Team Generator with Pandas
With the help of Google Colab, I built a quick team of 6 random generator with the following criteria:
1. Non-legendary Pokemon
2. No more than one Pokemon has the same type
3. Each pokemon must excel in one stat (HP, Attack, Def, SpAtk, SpDef, Speed) - That stat must be above average of the other Pokemons

### Packages used
Pandas, Random
